🚀 Cryptocurrency Price Trends Forecasting
🔮 The Future of Digital Assets – An In-Depth Data Science Exploration

Welcome to one of the most comprehensive open-source projects focused on analyzing and forecasting cryptocurrency prices using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. 🌐📈

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) are reshaping the financial world. But as exciting as this space is, it's also volatile and unpredictable. This project aims to decode the price movements and forecast the future trends of digital assets using a robust, data-driven approach. 🧠💹

🧩 Project Objective

📌 To analyze historical cryptocurrency market data, detect patterns, and build forecasting models that help predict future price trends — aiding investors, data scientists, researchers, and crypto-enthusiasts alike.
